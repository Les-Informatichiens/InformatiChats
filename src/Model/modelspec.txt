models/: This folder contains the classes that define data entities or models. Each model corresponds to a specific entity in the application.
For example:
User.h/cpp: Contains the User model class.
ChatClient.h/cpp: Contains the ChatClient model class.

DataAccess/: This folder contains the logic responsible for interacting with data sources, such as databases or APIs.
For example:
NetworkAPI.h/cpp: Contains functions/classes for network interactions (with libdatachannel as of now).

ApplicationLogic/: This folder houses the business logic specific to each model. Business logic involves data validation, calculations, and other rules that pertain to the model's behavior.
For example:
ChatClientLogic.h/cpp: Contains functions/classes for ChatClient-related business logic.
UserLogic.h/cpp: Contains functions/classes for UserLogic-related business logic.



Please note that:
Controllers should not directly access data access classes, but rather interact with application logic classes that encapsulate the data access operations.
